Soon:
Update system so there is one function, that you pass the padding function,
and the leakage analysis function to. 
So there is only one version of the code.


Future:
Look into using .har files instead.
Is any information actually needed lost?
.har seems to just have a list of HTTPSrequest/responses
which might be a better fit foor our analysis.
