// Cipher defines an interface to an abstract symmetric message cipher.
// The cipher embodies a secret that may be used to encrypt/decrypt data
// as well as to generate cryptographically random bits.
// The Cipher's state cryptographically absorbs all data that it processes,
// producing updated state usable to generate hashes and authenticators.
//
// The Crypt method encrypts or decrypts bytes through the Cipher,
// from a src byte-slice to a dst byte-slice.
// A call to Crypt always processes exactly max(len(src),len(dst) bytes.
// If src is shorter than dst, the missing src bytes are assumed to be zero.
// If dst is shorter than src, the extra output bytes are discarded.
// This means that Crypt(dst, nil) may be used to produce pseudorandom bytes,
// and Crypt(nil, src) may be used to absorb input without producing output.
// The cipher cryptographically pads or demarks calls in a cipher-specific way,
// so that a single call to Crypt(dst, src) yields a different result
// from Crypt(dst[:x], src[:x]) followed by Crypt(dst[x:], src[x:])
//
// Any Cipher has a configurable Direction, which may be
// OneWay, Encrypt, or Decrypt.
// OneWay is the default, suitable for hashing or generating random bytes.
// Encrypt and Decrypt provide a reversible transformation when needed.
// OneWay may be behaviorally equivalent to either Encrypt or Decrypt,
// depending on the specific Cipher.
//
// To form a keyed Cipher from a generic unkeyed Cipher,
// simply absorb the secret key via Crypt(nil, key).
// The key may be any length, but the KeySize method returns the optimal
// length for secret keys to achieve maximum security with this cipher.
//
// To compute a cryptographic hash, create an unkeyed Cipher,
// then absorb the message via Crypt(nil, message),
// and finally produce the digest via Crypt(digest, nil).
// The digest may be any length, but the HashSize method returns the optimal
// length for hashes to achieve maximum security with this cipher.
// To compute a keyed cryptographic hash or message-authenticator,
// follow the same procedure but using a keyed Cipher.
//
// For authenticated encryption, use Crypt(ciphertext, plaintext, Encrypt)
// to encrypt the message while absorbing its content into the Cipher,
// then use Crypt(digest, nil, Encrypt) to produce the message authenticator.
// To decrypt and authenticate, call Crypt(plaintext, ciphertext, Decrypt)
// then Crypt(digest, nil, Decrypt) and check the resulting authenticator.
// The plaintext byte-slice may be shorter than the ciphertext slice,
// in which case the plaintext is securely padded with zeros on encryption
// and the ciphertext padding bytes are dropped on decryption;
// these padding bytes are still absorbed into the cipher state for security.
