    - moved:
        - all examples from top level to examples/
        - all abstract/*go to top level
        - ed25519/, edwards/ and nist/ to group/
        - former nist/int.go to group/mod/int.go
        - eddsa to sign/eddsa
        - anon to sign/anon
        - cosi to sign/cosi
        - sign/schnorr.go to sign/schnorr/schnorr.go
        - math/{jacobi,sqrt} to group/mod/
        - config/key.go - the KeyPair struct + methods - to /util/key/
        - hash/ to util/hash
        - ints/ints.go to util/ints/ints.go
        - util/{reverse,grow,replace} to util/bytes/
        - group/encoding.go to util/encoding/encoding.go
        - subtle/ to util/subtle
        - random to util/random
