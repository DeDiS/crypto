DeDiS Advanced Crypto Library for Go
====================================

This package provides a toolbox of advanced cryptographic primitives for Go,
targeting applications like [Dissent](http://dedis.cs.yale.edu/dissent/)
that need more than straightforward signing and encryption.
Please see the
[GoDoc documentation for this package](http://godoc.org/github.com/DeDiS/crypto)
for details on the library's purpose and functionality.

Installing
----------

To install, first make sure you have [Go](https://golang.org)
version 1.3 or newer installed, then run:

	go get github.com/dedis/crypto

You should then be able to test its basic function as follows:

	cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/dedis/crypto
	go test -v

You can recursively test all the packages in the library as follows,
keeping in mind that some sub-packages will only build
if certain dependencies are satisfied as described below:

	go test -v ./...

Dependencies
------------

The library's basic functionality depends only on the Go standard library.
However, parts of the library will only build if certain other,
optional system packages are installed with their header files and libraries
(e.g., the "-dev" version of the package).
In particular:

- crypto.openssl: This sub-package is a wrapper that builds on
the [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) crypto library
to provide a fast, mature implementation
of NIST-standardized elliptic curves and symmetric cryptosystems.

- crypto.pbc: This is a wrapper for the
[Stanford Pairing-Based Crypto (PBC) library](http://crypto.stanford.edu/pbc/),
which will of course only work if the PBC library is installed.
